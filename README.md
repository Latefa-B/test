# Step-by-Step Guide to Deploy a 3-Tier AWS Architecture with Terraform 
Step-by-Step Guide to Deploy a 3-Tier AWS Architecture with Load Balancer and Auto Scaling Using Terraform - Part 1 : Web Tier
Deploying a 3-Tier Architecture with Load Balancer and Auto Scaling using Terraform as an Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool, is a powerful approach to provision and manage such a robust Cloud Infrastructure. Deploying and managing it can be complex and time-consuming, but Terraform enables us to automate the process, in a consistent, efficient and repeatable way, reducing human errors.
This comprehensive step-by-step guide walks you through the process of  deploying a 3-Tier Architecture with Load Balancer and Auto Scaling on AWS using a modular and production-style Terraform setup. This project consists of two parts :
- **Part 1 : we will be deploying on the web-tier, using AWS services like : VPC, Subnets, Route Tables, Internet Gateway (IGW), Application Load Balancer (ALB), Launch Template, Auto Scaling Group, EC2 instances and Security Group.**
- **Part 2 : we will be focusing on the application and database tiers, using AWS services like : VPC, Subnets, NAT Gateway, Internet Gateway, Route Tables, Security Groups, Bastion EC2, App EC2 (private), MySQL RDS and ALB + Auto Scaling.**

For this purpose, we will : 
- Create a VPC, subnets, internet gateway, and routing
- Deploy multiple EC2 instances automatically using an Auto Scaling Group
- Balance incoming traffic with a Load Balancer
- Use Security Groups to control access
- Install a web server (nginx) on all EC2s using User Data.

The aim of this project is to : 
- Build a secure, production-style 3-tier VPC environment using a modular Terraform setup.
- Organize Terraform code into separate files like in real-word production to keep the code  clean, maintainable and reusable.
- Understand how to define a custom VPC in Terraform’s Configuration files and how Auto Scaling and Load Balancing work together.
- Use outputs to connect your infrastructure to real services (like web browsers) 
- Use Launch Templates, ALB, and Auto Scaling Groups
- Deploy RDS in private subnets
- Understand bastion SSH and private EC2 workflows

## Prerequisites
In order to proceed, we need to make sure beforehand to : 
- Have Terraform and AWS CLI installed. 
- Have AWS credentials (aws configure) configured.
- Create a new working directory and create inside it the configuration files : provider.tf vpc.tf security_group.tf alb.tf launch_template.tf autoscaling.tf outputs.tf
<img width="990" height="278" alt="0" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/42bdf445-3e2a-4c40-b777-5d920cc9cd3f" />


Each configuration file defines how to provision and manage infrastructure resources, and describe the desired state of your infrastructure. 

- **provider.tf**  : defines the AWS region and provider setup.
- **vpc.tf** : defines the VPC and the networking components.
- **outputs.tf** : contains information like Public IP of EC2, subnet IDs, etc.
- **security_group.tf** : is for access control
- **alb.tf** : defines the infrastructure for the application load balancer.
- **autoscaling.tf** : defines and manages the autoscaling group.
- **launch_template.tf** : defines the launch template resource.

## Step-by-Step Instructions : 
### Step 1: Configure AWS Provider
On your configuration file provider.tf , write the code below. This tells Terraform to use AWS as a provider and the region us-east-1 as a region where all the resources will be created. The region us-east-1 is stable and free-tier friendly.
<img width="560" height="135" alt="2" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bdcee071-e2a0-45e7-89f3-e8f5910e64fb" />

### Step 2: Create VPC and Subnets
On your vpc.tf configuration file, add the code below. This will create a virtual private network on AWS, configure two public subnets in two different availability zones. Then,  will assign them public IP addresses. Configuring at least two public subnets in two different availability zones within the VPC allows the application to stay available if one zone fails.
<img width="743" height="374" alt="4" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/20e18558-d466-4712-af47-53a9ddcf3789" />

### Step 3: Add Internet Access
On your vpc.tf configuration file, add the code below. This will : 
- Configure an Internet Gateway. It will allow the Public subnet to have access to the internet. 
- Configure a public route table and associate it to the internet Gateway and to both public subnets.
- Without the internet, no one can visit your application. The Internet Gateway lets the servers inside your VPC connect to the outside world.

### Step 4: Set Up Security Groups
On your security_group.tf configuration file, add the code below. This will configure two security groups. Security Groups act like locked doors. The ALB SG allows HTTP traffic on port 80. The EC2 SG allows only HTTP traffic from the ALB on port 80, as well.
<img width="816" height="599" alt="10" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/52105da3-c13c-4eb1-9ba2-f69dd61d85b8" />

### Step 5: Create the Load Balancer
On your alb.tf configuration file, add the code below. This will configure a load balancer, a target group and a listener for the ALB on Port 80. The load balancer spreads traffic across multiple EC2s. If one EC2 fails, the others will still work.
<img width="736" height="551" alt="13" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/be1704b0-3a17-4b99-96fd-8b586d07afa7" />

### Step 6: Create Launch Template
On your launch_template.tf configuration file, add the code below. This will create a launch template for the EC2 instances and the Auto Scaling Group. A Launch Template is like a blueprint for EC2 instances. It installs nginx, starts the service, and shows a custom message.
<img width="663" height="345" alt="15" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a949cb9e-4c76-45ad-a48f-d06c39f370c6" />

### Step 7: Create Auto Scaling Group
- On your autoscaling.tf  configuration file, add the code below. This will create an auto scaling group for your application and will use the Launch Template created previously. The Auto Scaling Group automatically launches multiple EC2s based on demand. It connects them to the Load Balancer for traffic distribution.

<img width="647" height="355" alt="17" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/671e0e1a-45aa-4fb4-989f-c509bc2fa389" />

### Step 8: Output the Load Balancer URL
On your outputs.tf file, write the code below. The output.tf configuration file is optional but helpful, it allows users to understand the configuration and review its expected outputs. It shows your load balancer's public URL after Terraform finishes.
<img width="547" height="164" alt="19" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3404b60f-e2d8-43a2-a706-08fa69596473" />

### Step 9 : Deploy Your Infrastructure
Now that we have defined the configuration files, we will deploy the infrastructure.
- Run terraform init command : to Initialize the working directory/project, download the necessary plugins and prepare terraform.
<img width="799" height="312" alt="20" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/29883145-0c66-4212-b0ba-ff9e35ec2fd2" />

- Run terraform plan command : to preview what changes will happen, before Terraform applies them.

- Check your infrastructure on the AWS Console. The VPC was created as well as its components : 
- **VPC**
<img width="1440" height="746" alt="34" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8ed593ac-b31f-41bd-918d-eb321a4d970b" />

### Step 10 : Destroy (Cleanup)
Now that your web server application was deployed successfully, clean up your infrastructure ! This prevents charges on your AWS account.
- Run terraform destroy command : to delete the infrastructure and remove all the resources managed by terraform.
- Type yes when prompted.

### Summary
This breakdown provides a step-by-step guide to deploy a 3-Tier Architecture with Load Balancer and Auto Scaling on AWS using Terraform. By completing this lab, we had an overview on how to : 
- Build the infrastructure from scratch using a modular and production-style Terraform setup, from creating the VPC, to configuring subnets and internet gateway, to connecting to the internet using Internet Gateway and understanding how routing works in AWS  but also to deploying multiple EC2 instances automatically using an Auto Scaling Group, balancing incoming traffic with a Load Balancer and what security best practices to set up with security groups to control access.
- Organize Terraform code into separate files like in real-word production to keep the code clean, maintainable and reusable. Separating configuration files in blocks has several benefits like enhancing scalability, a better organization and team collaboration. It improves readability, reusability and maintainability of the code. It allows different teams to work on different parts of the project at the same time. Helps manage large and complex infrastructure, but also, promotes faster troubleshooting.

Building Infrastructure with Terraform as an IaC tool is an approach that not only provision, manage, and replicate cloud resources in a predictable and automated way. But also, reduces manual errors and enhances the scalability and maintainability of the infrastructure. This approach of building infrastructure using IaC, demonstrated how it can simplify and automate the process of deploying and managing a well-structured private network environment that requires high security and scalability and more complex cloud infrastructures. But also how Terraform lays the foundation for modern DevOps practices such as CI/CD, monitoring, and infrastructure testing.


# Step-by-Step Guide to Deploy a 3-Tier AWS Architecture Using Terraform - Part 2 : Application & Database Tiers
Deploying a 3-Tier Architecture with Load Balancer and Auto Scaling using Terraform as an Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool, is a powerful approach to provision and manage such a robust Cloud Infrastructure. Deploying and managing it can be complex and time-consuming, but Terraform enables us to automate the process, in a consistent, efficient and repeatable way, reducing human errors.
This comprehensive step-by-step guide walks you through the process of  deploying a 3-Tier Architecture on AWS using a modular and production-style Terraform setup. Previously, we have deployed the web tier only of this 3-tier Architecture with ALB and ASG. In this part, we will be focusing on the application and database tiers, using AWS services like : VPC, Subnets, NAT Gateway, Internet Gateway, Route Tables, Security Groups, Bastion EC2, App EC2 (private), MySQL RDS and ALB + Auto Scaling. The aim of this project is to : 
- Build a secure, production-style 3-tier VPC environment
- Use Launch Templates, ALB, and Auto Scaling Groups
- Deploy RDS in private subnets
- Use Terraform modularity and outputs
- Understand bastion SSH and private EC2 workflows

## Prerequisites 
In order to proceed, we need to make sure beforehand to : 
- Have Terraform and AWS CLI installed. 
- Have AWS credentials (aws configure) configured.
- Have completed part 1 of deploying the web tier.
- Inside the folder previously created for the web tier, create the configuration files : bastion.tf app_server.tf rds.tf nat_gateway.tf
<img width="928" height="330" alt="0" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6e20ea73-c2c4-4e92-a3ea-fc5b71846e9f" />

Each configuration file defines how to provision and manage infrastructure resources, and describe the desired state of your infrastructure. 

- **bastion.tf** : define and deploy a bastion host.
- **app_server.tf** : defines the infrastructure for an application server.
- **rds.tf** : defines the configuration to create and manage the RDS database instance. 
- **nat_gateway.tf** : define and configure a NAT gateway within the VPC.

## Design of the Application Architecture on AWS
<img width="449" height="672" alt="Screenshot 2025-07-08 at 11 52 38 AM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2f158b7b-8fdb-4191-b754-92766cd15d0e" />

## Step-by-Step Instructions : 
### Step 1: Add Private Subnets for the Application and the Databases
On your configuration file vpc.tf , append the code below. This tells Terraform to create three private subnets within the VPC. Two private subnets for the databases and one private subnet that will host the application backend’s. 
<img width="742" height="844" alt="2" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2b22db76-9bad-43a9-a701-a5c3f195a72e" />
<img width="523" height="234" alt="3" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/80488555-1994-4104-b511-c090345cf1a2" />

### Step 2: Add NAT Gateway and Private Routing
- On your nat_gateway.tf configuration file, add the code below. This will create a Nat Gateway on your VPC, configure private route tables and associate them to the private subnets. The NAT allows resources in private subnets to reach the internet for software updates without being exposed to it.

<img width="498" height="529" alt="5" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cdf67bef-3b80-4617-bba8-470b98ac753f" />

### Step 3: Add Bastion Host
- On your bastion.tf configuration file, add the code below. This will create an EC2 instance in the public subnet that will be used as a bastion host for the application.

<img width="570" height="188" alt="7" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ae60adcd-8794-4a9b-ac83-b0776ecfd001" />


### Step 4: App Tier EC2 (Private)
- On your app_server.tf configuration file, add the code below. This will configure the application in the private subnet. Your application logic should not be accessible directly from the internet.

<img width="567" height="314" alt="9" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d02d30c3-86db-4205-b756-3aefbb021c28" />


### Step 5: RDS in Private Subnets
On your rds.tf configuration file, add the code below. This will configure the RDS Database instance. Databases are sensitive and should always live in private subnets, only accessible by specific EC2s.
<img width="563" height="351" alt="11" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/40beca2b-c7b1-405a-afcc-68cc5e0d2f59" />


### Step 6: Outputs
- On your outputs.tf file, append the code below. The output.tf configuration file is optional but helpful, it allows users to understand the configuration and review its expected outputs. It shows the frontend alb dns, the bastion's public URL and the tds endpoint after Terraform finishes applying the configuration.
  
<img width="460" height="297" alt="13" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b79969e6-719b-4507-9d2e-9d22ea04c817" />


### Step 7 : Deploy Your Infrastructure
Now that we have defined the configuration files, we will deploy the infrastructure.
- Run terraform init command : to Initialize the working directory/project, download the necessary plugins and prepare terraform.
<img width="610" height="263" alt="14" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cd6bb0bc-307b-418b-bf9f-aa2305bd8f50" />

- Run terraform plan command : to preview what changes will happen, before Terraform applies them. 

- **Errors** : Running the command Terraform plan allows you to preview the changes but also to preview the errors that might occur, before applying the code. The errors that occur after running the “terraform plan” command are related to undeclared resources (security groups) and unsupported arguments.

<img width="756" height="487" alt="15" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ce0fba60-0e8c-47ff-915e-dca3ceca7c23" />

**Error 1** : Reference to undeclared resource : This means that terraform can not find any resource named aws_security_group.app_sg. 
<img width="732" height="113" alt="22" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5562bf6d-f59c-43e4-8e0f-97b0fabb12a8" />

**Troubleshooting Error 1** : To troubleshoot the error :  
- Check if the resource has been declared in the security group configuration file or in any terraform configuration file.
- If yes, make sure the name of the resource is correct and it is not defined inside a different module.
- If not, add the resource to the security_group.tf configuration file where all the security groups related to the application are defined.
- In our case, the resource has not been declared in the root module. to fix it, we will append the code below in the security_group.tf configuration file : 
<img width="441" height="266" alt="16" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4926a18c-ab28-415b-965e-9c038ccf3903" />

**This code tells Terraform to allow in the application tier : SSH inbound traffic only from the Bastion Host and to allow all outbound traffic.**

**Error 2** : Reference to undeclared resource : This means, like the previous error, that that terraform can not find any resource named aws_security_group.bastion_sg declared in the root module. 
<img width="702" height="121" alt="23" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b75a9ded-2aa3-42cc-9169-fc0f5f32f9cd" />

**Troubleshooting Error 2** : To troubleshoot the error we will follow the same process. In the security_group.tf configuration file, append the code below: 
<img width="359" height="254" alt="17" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/09b1ce56-ab60-4dc4-b44b-90c155b83e6d" />

**This code tells Terraform to allow in the bastion host instance : SSH inbound traffic only from your trusted IP address and to allow all outbound traffic.**

**Error 3** : Unsupported argument : This means that the argument ‘vpc’ is not supported by the resource or module in your Terraform configuration.
<img width="720" height="111" alt="24" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5656c576-a39e-4bbe-87ca-9a5d106af5cd" />

**Troubleshooting Error 3** : To troubleshoot the error : 
- Go to the official website of HashiCorp Terraform Registry -> Browse by Providers (or Modules) -> Select AWS -> Select your resource, then Check the most up to date Terraform code.  https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/resources/eip#vpc
- To fix it, replace the previous code in the nat_gateway.tf configuration file with the code below  : 
<img width="437" height="52" alt="18" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ea9713ee-089f-43a2-9ea3-6888a4bafb6d" />

**Error 4**: Reference to undeclared resource : This means that terraform can not find any resource named aws_security_group.rds_sg. 

**Troubleshooting Error 4** : To troubleshoot the error we will follow the same process mentioned previously :  
- Check if the resource has been declared in the security group configuration file or in any terraform configuration file.
- If yes, make sure the name of the resource is correct and it is not defined inside a different module.
- If not, add the resource to the security_group.tf configuration file where all the security groups related to the application are defined.
- In our case, the resource has not been declared in the root module. to fix it, we will append the code below in the security_group.tf configuration file : 
<img width="440" height="256" alt="19" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7f7271ee-40b5-4720-9d4f-aac1463a2571" />

**This code tells Terraform to allow MySQL from the application tier only on Port 3306 and to allow all outbound traffic.**

- Now that we have configured all our security groups, let’s check again the terraform code with the ‘terraform plan’ command !

- **Error 5**: Another error occurred

<img width="647" height="121" alt="20" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c0289a86-aa79-43b1-8c20-855ce3c71eb8" />

**Troubleshooting Error 5** : to troubleshoot it follow the process on the official website of Terraform Hashicorp and replace the deprecated argument with the most up to date one : https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/resources/db_instance#name
<img width="525" height="312" alt="21" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b8a2571d-939e-44ea-99b4-0bdf2a9344f6" />


Now that we have fixed the configuration files, run the ‘terraform plan’ command to preview the infrastructure changes before applying them !

- Run terraform apply command : to apply the changes and build the infrastructure. Type yes when prompted.

### Step 8 : Test the Application
Now that we have deployed the infrastructure and the Application we will test the application.
To connect to the Application tier EC2 instance from the bastion host instance : Copy the ssh key pair from your local server to the bastion server  using scp command then SSH into the bastion host instance from your local server.
- SSH into the application tier instance from the bastion host
- Test the application using Curl command

### Step 9 : Destroy (Cleanup)
Now that your web server application was deployed successfully, clean up your infrastructure ! This prevents charges on your AWS account.
- Run terraform destroy command : to delete the infrastructure and remove all the resources managed by terraform.
- Type yes when prompted.

### Summary
This breakdown provides a step-by-step guide to deploy a 3-Tier Architecture (web tier, app tier and db tier), with Load Balancer and Auto Scaling on AWS using Terraform. By completing this lab, we had an overview on how to : 
- Build a secure, production-style 3-tier VPC environment using a modular and production-style Terraform setup : From setting up the Virtual Private Network : VPC and its components, to setting up the ALB, and Auto Scaling Groups for the Web Tie, to setting up the bastion host to access the private EC2 Instance in the Application Tier to configuring an RDS Database for the DB Tier. 
- Organize Terraform code into separate files like in real-word production to keep the code clean, maintainable and reusable. Separating configuration files in blocks has several benefits like enhancing scalability, a better organization and team collaboration. It improves readability, reusability and maintainability of the code. It allows different teams to work on different parts of the project at the same time. Helps manage large and complex infrastructure, but also, promotes faster troubleshooting.

Building Infrastructure with Terraform as an IaC tool is an approach that not only provision, manage, and replicate cloud resources in a predictable and automated way. But also, reduces manual errors and enhances the scalability and maintainability of the infrastructure. This approach of building infrastructure using IaC, demonstrated how it can simplify and automate the process of deploying and managing a well-structured private network environment that requires high security and scalability and more complex cloud infrastructures. But also how Terraform lays the foundation for modern DevOps practices such as CI/CD, monitoring, and infrastructure testing.
